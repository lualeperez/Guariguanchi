GUARIGUANCHI is a tool for a simplified calculation of tracking performances 
which is fast and can be used as an intermediate step in the process of tracking 
system optimization. It allows to quickly compare different detector geometries 
as well as combinations of sensor performances leading to a reduced set of 
configurations for deeper studies with full-simulation. The tool also allows to 
optimize beam-test setups in terms of telescope pointing resolution at the device 
under test location. The pdf document inside the doc/ folder presents the basis to 
install and start using GUARIGUANCHI. The document also provides all the information 
about the code structure and presents guide-lines on how to extend it.
